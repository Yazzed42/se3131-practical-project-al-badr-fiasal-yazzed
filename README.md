# Formal specification using Petri Nets

using petri nets we formally specify the following system:

we have a traffic crossroads that organize 4 different lanes

only certain traffic light can become green at the same time and the rest of traffic lights are red.

the traffic lights must work with the order mentioned in the picture.

The two traffic lights at lane 1 can be green and the rest are red.

The two traffic lights at lane 2 can be green and the rest are red.

The traffic light at lane 3 can be green and the rest are red.

The traffic light at lane 4 can be green and the rest are red.

The traffic light at lane 5 allows cars to return when it is not conflict with another traffic light.
